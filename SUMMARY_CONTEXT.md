# Project Change Summary and Rationale (from start to current)

This document captures the key instructions, decisions, and logic applied throughout the recent iteration cycle.

TL;DR (Read This First)
- Theme: dark by default; soft off‑white text; cyan neon accents (#00E5FF) used sparingly (focus/beam).
- Fonts: Plus Jakarta Sans via next/font (variable retained as --font-geist-sans).
- Hero: no heavy background; optional subtle stripes; badge transparent; cloud removed unless tinted neon and requested.
- Beam: circles solid dark (bg-neutral-950, border-white/10), neon glow on hover, beam gradient cyan→violet; logos via chain‑registry or local @2x.
- Live feed: Cosmos governance/upgrade only; sanitize (no emoji/links), ≤ 105 chars; one event/interval; dedupe IDs; SSE supports chains=all.
- Our Networks: heading gradient readable (≤ hero size); top graphic masked (SVG preferred), fade 100→0 bottom; responsive negative margins; right-side dark gradient accent.
- Keep everything responsive (padding on mobile, sane z-index, non-interactive décor).

Do / Don’t
- Do use theme tokens (bg-background, text-foreground, bg-card) instead of raw black/white.
- Do use SVG or @2x images for crispness; set explicit sizes in Next/Image.
- Do mask images with gradients for fades and color fills (vector masks where possible).
- Do sanitize live content (strip emoji/links) and enforce 105 char limit on notification title/description.
- Do dedupe live events by ID and emit 1 event/interval to keep animations consistent.
- Don’t reintroduce heavy gradient overlays or bright solid backgrounds.
- Don’t use react-spring in React 19 paths; avoid brittle deps for globe—use dynamic imports.
- Don’t let section headings exceed hero’s visual weight on desktop.

## High-level Goals
- Align visuals with a retro–futuristic, abstract-tech aesthetic while keeping strong contrast and readability.
- Modernize sections (notifications, hero, showcase) with consistent behavior, responsiveness, and clean code paths.
- Ensure reliability (remove brittle deps, avoid build errors) and maintain flexibility for future tweaks.

---

## Theme and Global Styling
- Initially changed background to white, then locked theme to light to stop unexpected dark-mode flips.
- Later switched to always-dark theme for retro‑futuristic vibe that is not pure black:
  - Forced `dark` in ThemeProvider (disable system), used `bg-background text-foreground` in wrappers.
  - Adjusted `.dark` palette to be softer off‑white foreground and neon cyan for ring/primary.
- Explored custom themes (retro/techcore), then rolled back global overlays to reduce clutter and keep the interface clean.
- Font: replaced Geist with Plus Jakarta Sans via `next/font/google` (kept CSS variable names to avoid large refactors).

Quick theme rules
- `.dark` palette: foreground ≈ #e5e7eb (not pure white); border/input slightly visible; ring/primary #00E5FF.
- Use `bg-background text-foreground` everywhere; avoid ad‑hoc colors unless for accents.

## Animated List (Notifications) and Cosmos Live Feed
- Copywriting updated to validator/network tone; made the demo component accept `items` props and ReactNode icons.
- Added presets (Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot) with SVG icons (lucide-react), then later focused on Cosmos only.
- Built live SSE API `GET /api/cosmos/stream`:
  - First version: polled RPC block height — reverted (too noisy and not aligned with requirements).
  - Final logic: poll REST cosmos.directory for governance and upgrade events only:
    - Events: `proposal` (new), `proposal_status` (status changed), `proposal_ending_soon` (voting close window), `upgrade` (current plan changed).
    - Dedupe by ID to avoid duplicates across reconnects/polls.
    - Support query params: `chains` (e.g., `all` pulls full list from chains.cosmos.directory), `interval`, `endingSoonMs`.
    - Round-robin/random poll strategy so feed continues without flooding.
- AnimatedList behavior and keys:
  - Original prepend+index caused inconsistent animation; fixed by ensuring unique keys, append strategy when needed, and feeding items one-by-one for consistent motion.
  - Added throttled queue option; later simplified to append with timing and delay control.
- Text constraints and sanitization:
  - Limit title and description to 105 chars (including spaces/punct).
  - Remove emojis, URLs, and markdown images; chain name is UPPERCASE and bold in description.
  - Headings standardized (e.g., “New Proposal #ID”, “Upgrade Scheduled: NAME”).
- UX “Live” badge & connection dot added to the feed (open/connecting/closed), kept subtle.

API and client rules
- SSE endpoint: `/api/cosmos/stream` with query params:
  - `chains=all` (load all chain slugs from chains.cosmos.directory), `interval` (ms), `endingSoonMs` (ms window for “ending soon”).
- Events: `proposal`, `proposal_status`, `proposal_ending_soon`, `upgrade`.
- Client dedupe: store seen IDs; append items, cap length (≤ 50).
- Sanitize: strip emoji ranges/ZWJ, markdown images, URLs; collapse whitespace; 105 char cap.

## TrustedBy Carousel
- Converted CSS animation to a resilient utility:
  - Defined `.animate-marquee` in globals and applied it with `--duration` and `--gap` CSS variables.
  - Later replaced with a `requestAnimationFrame` DOM scroller for seamless, non-reset movement (no dependency on prefers-reduced-motion, robust wrap-around).
- Ensured responsivity and masking for smooth edges.

Implementation options
- CSS util approach: `.animate-marquee` + `--duration` + `--gap`, masked edges.
- rAF ticker fallback: translateX with seamless wrap; pause on hover.

## Bento Grid and Card Styling
- Lightened the card surface initially; then refined to theme tokens for consistency:
  - Switched cards to `bg-card border-border shadow-sm`, used `text-foreground` and `text-muted-foreground` for copy.
- Removed experimental frame overlays for cleanliness.

Card rules
- Card surfaces: `bg-card border border-border shadow-sm`; copy with `text-foreground` / `text-muted-foreground`.
- Dark hover overlays must remain subtle.

## Hero Section
- Transitioned away from a bright gradient to a dark-card feel, then removed the hero background entirely per request and replaced with a subtle striped pattern (radial mask) for a retro-tech accent.
- Cloud asset handling:
  - Originally blended white cloud; later colorized with a neon cyan radial tint (screen blend), then completely removed on request.
- Badge adjustments:
  - Made badge transparent, softened borders, retained the ping light.
  - Modified the light animation to move back-and-forth and added a subtle wobble effect.

## Beam (Animated Beams + Logos)
- Replaced third-party brand icons with Cosmos chain logos from chain-registry (Next Image remote patterns added for raw.githubusercontent).
- Swapped center node to local logos (logo.png → logos.png → astro.png → astro@2x for crispness) and later user-requested images.
- Adjusted beam gradient to cyan→violet and used solid dark circles with hover neon glow & inner ring.
- Provided consistent sizing via `sizes`, `priority`, 2x assets for sharpness.

Beam rules
- Circles: `bg-neutral-950 border-white/10`, hover neon glow (shadow + inner inset ring).
- Gradient path: cyan → violet; pathOpacity ~0.15; pathWidth default (adjust if needed).
- Logos: prefer SVG; else @2x; add remotePatterns in next.config for chain-registry.

## “Our Networks” Section (Showcase)
- Heavily iterated the heading and top graphic per requests:
  - Added, then removed, Cobe globe; replaced with several images (cubes/memek/jemvut/peler) and finally used `trace (1).svg` as a mask to fill with gradient for crisp vector edges.
  - Applied a bottom fade (100% → 0%) via mask to the top graphic.
  - Heading styling evolved: big gradient text, stroke and drop-shadow tweaks for contrast, then size reductions to not exceed hero heading sizing.
  - Positioned graphic to align and overlap the heading, with responsive negative margins.
  - Added a subtle right-side dark gradient accent and section spacing from previous Bento content.
- Copywriting adjusted to section context: “Networks we validate and secure across the Interchain.”
- Ensured mobile-friendly:
  - Reduced right gradient width on small screens.
  - Tuned negative margins (-mb) responsively.
- Added container padding (px-4) for mobile.

Showcase playbook
- Heading: gradient text (light: black→neutral‑700; dark: white→white/90), font-bold or extrabold; add drop-shadow + small text-stroke for clarity.
- Top graphic: prefer SVG mask (e.g., `trace (1).svg`), fill with gradient background; apply bottom fade (white→transparent) to wrapper; overlap heading with responsive `-mb`.
- Right-side accent: `absolute right-0 inset-y-0 w-16 sm:w-24 md:w-32 bg-gradient-to-l from-black/20 to-transparent`.
- Keep heading ≤ hero title size (e.g., text-4xl sm:5xl md:6xl).

## Navbar and Logos
- Replaced the text badge “K” with image logos (astro.png → astro@2x.png) for crisper display; kept size compact (28px).

## Cobe Globe: Stability and Build Fixes
- Removed `react-spring` usage in the globe component; implemented a simple ref-based control.
- Fixed “Module not found: cobe” by using dynamic import with `eval('import("cobe")')` and safe guards (no crash if not installed).
- Added `cobe` to package.json; requires running `pnpm install` locally for the globe to render.

Globe rules
- Use dynamic import (eval('import("cobe")')) and try/catch to avoid build failures when cobe is missing.
- No react-spring; use simple refs for rotation deltas.

## Responsiveness and Polish
- Ensured most decorative layers are non-interactive (`pointer-events-none`) and composited behind content (`z-index` control).
- Mask/fade and gradient overlays sized by breakpoint to avoid overwhelming content on mobile.
- Text sizes adjusted to respect visual hierarchy (Our Networks ≤ Hero title).

Responsive checklist
- Use container padding on mobile (`px-4`) and `max-w-*` to avoid edge collisions.
- Adjust negative margins by breakpoint (`-mb-12 sm:-mb-16 md:-mb-20`).
- Scale right-side accent width by breakpoint (`w-16 sm:w-24 md:w-32`).

---

## Open Follow-ups / Notes
- If you want the Cobe globe active again, run `pnpm install` to fetch the `cobe` module (dynamic import already in place).
- For perfect crispness on logos, prefer SVG sources when available; PNGs were upgraded to @2x where SVG wasn’t provided.
- The live Cosmos feed can be fine-tuned (chains whitelist, poll interval, endingSoonMs) by editing `/api/cosmos/stream` or via query params.

## Files Touched (Key)
- Theme/fonts: `components/theme-provider.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/globals.css`
- Animated list and live feed: `components/ui/animated-list-demo.tsx`, `components/cosmos/LiveCosmosFeed.tsx`, `app/api/cosmos/stream/route.ts`, `lib/notifications-presets.tsx`

# Quick Tasks (Recipes)

1) Make beam circles solid + glow
- File: `components/ui/animated-beam-multiple-outputs.tsx` (and `components/ui/Beam.tsx`)
- Circle class: `bg-neutral-950 border-white/10 p-2 group hover:shadow-[0_0_24px_-6px_rgba(0,229,255,0.45)] hover:border-[#00e5ff]/40`
- Add inner ring overlay (absolute inset-0 opacity transition) for hover.

2) Point beam logos to chain-registry
- Add remotePatterns `raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/chain-registry/**` in `next.config.ts`.
- Use `<Image width height sizes priority />` and prefer @2x.

3) Set Our Networks heading and top graphic (vector mask)
- Heading span classes: `text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent gradient ...` with light/dark variants.
- Top graphic div: `bg-gradient-to-b …` with `mask-image: url(/trace (1).svg)`; wrapper masked bottom (white→transparent) for fade.

4) Cosmos live feed stable
- Server: `/api/cosmos/stream` (REST poll); enable events `proposal, proposal_status, proposal_ending_soon, upgrade`.
- Client: dedupe by ID; sanitize; append one per interval; cap list (≤ 50).

5) Force dark theme
- `components/theme-provider.tsx`: set `defaultTheme="dark" forcedTheme="dark" enableSystem={false}`.

6) Fix COBE build error
- Use dynamic import; add `cobe` to package.json; instruct `pnpm install` locally.

---

# Known Pitfalls
- Using pure white text in dark theme leads to harsh contrast; use off‑white.
- Marquee relying only on CSS may pause under reduce‑motion; rAF ticker is safer for seamless loops.
- Prepending list items with index keys breaks animation; always provide stable keys and append strategy.
- Heavy overlays (multiple gradients/patterns) can clash; keep décor subtle and responsive.

---

# Task → Files + Steps (Idiot‑Proof Map)

- Make “Our Networks” heading smaller than Hero
  - Files: `components/sections/showcase.tsx`
  - Steps: adjust heading classes to `text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl`; keep `font-bold`; leave stroke/drop‑shadow.

- Apply gradient fill to top graphic using vector mask
  - Files: `components/sections/showcase.tsx`, `public/trace (1).svg`
  - Steps: set wrapper with bottom fade mask (white→transparent); set inner div with `bg-gradient-to-*` and `mask-image: url(/trace (1).svg)`; size with `h-XX md:h-YY`.

- Add right-side dark accent on “Our Networks”
  - Files: `components/sections/showcase.tsx`
  - Steps: add absolute overlay at section root: `absolute inset-y-0 right-0 w-16 sm:w-24 md:w-32 bg-gradient-to-l from-black/20 to-transparent`.

- Make beam circles solid + add neon hover
  - Files: `components/ui/animated-beam-multiple-outputs.tsx`, `components/ui/Beam.tsx`
  - Steps: Circle classes → `bg-neutral-950 border-white/10 p-2 group ...`; add inner overlay (absolute inset-0) with inset ring on hover.

- Switch beam logos to Cosmos chain registry
  - Files: `components/ui/animated-beam-multiple-outputs.tsx`, `next.config.ts`
  - Steps: whitelist `raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/chain-registry/**`; replace children in Circle with `<Image ...>` from chain-registry; set `width/height/sizes/priority`.

- Enable Cosmos live feed (governance/upgrade only)
  - Files: `app/api/cosmos/stream/route.ts`, `components/cosmos/LiveCosmosFeed.tsx`
  - Steps: ensure events (`proposal`, `proposal_status`, `proposal_ending_soon`, `upgrade`); sanitize text; dedupe by ID; one event per interval; client feed shows stable animations.

- Force dark theme
  - Files: `components/theme-provider.tsx`, wrappers using `bg-background text-foreground`.
  - Steps: `defaultTheme="dark"`, `forcedTheme="dark"`, `enableSystem={false}`; remove white hard-coded backgrounds.

- Fix COBE “module not found”
  - Files: `components/ui/cobe-globe.tsx`, `package.json`
  - Steps: dynamic import cobe via `eval('import("cobe")')`; catch errors; add `cobe` to package.json and instruct `pnpm install` locally.

# One‑Liners (Most Requested)

- “Jarak lebih jauh dari Bento” → add `mt-8 md:mt-12` to Showcase section.
- “Gambar menyatu ke heading” → increase overlap: `-mb-12 sm:-mb-16 md:-mb-20` on wrapper.
- “Heading lebih jelas” → adjust gradient to `from-black to-neutral-700` (light) / `from-white to-white/90` (dark), add `drop-shadow` + `WebkitTextStroke: 0.25px`.
- “Semua circle warna gelap” → Circle class `bg-neutral-950 border-white/10` everywhere.
- “Beam gradient match tema” → `<AnimatedBeam gradientStartColor="#00e5ff" gradientStopColor="#7c3aed" pathColor="#00e5ff" pathOpacity={0.15} />`.

- Summary: Updated hero card to use a full-cover background image (/public/hero.webp), increased container to max-w-[1100px] with px-12 py-20, added premium corner bracket accents (3px thick, 24px long) on all corners, kept page background pure black, ensured centered layout, set all text to white, and used a white oval CTA with bold black text. Added subtle white glow `shadow-[0_0_60px_rgba(255,255,255,0.08)]`.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Implements the requested premium “corner bracket” style with strong focus and contrast.
- Follow-ups: Optionally add a light darkening overlay over the image for extra legibility depending on artwork.

- Author: Agent
- Summary: Raised hero closer to navbar and matched width to the “Loved by teams” grid by wrapping the card in a `max-w-6xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` container. Removed full viewport vertical centering and set top/bottom paddings for tighter spacing.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Ensures visual alignment across sections and reduces excess whitespace under the navbar.
- Follow-ups: Fine-tune top/bottom paddings after live review; consider small negative top margin if you want it even tighter.

- ID: fix-hero-section-jsx-error
- Date: 2025-10-20 01:18 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Fixed a missing closing container div in `components/hero-section.tsx` that caused a Turbopack parse error during build. Component now compiles.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Resolve build parsing error introduced during layout refactor.
- Follow-ups: Current build fails on unrelated ESLint rules; consider ignoring ESLint during build or addressing lint errors separately.
Entry
- ID: hero-kerenstake-validator-copy
- Date: 2025-10-20 01:25 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Updated hero copy to a validator-focused message for KerenStake: badge “KerenStake — Interchain Validator”, headline “Stake Confidently with KerenStake”, descriptive subcopy about enterprise-grade ops, and CTA label “Delegate Now”.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Aligns homepage messaging with validator brand and services.
- Follow-ups: Replace badge link target with the final About/Partners page when ready.
Entry
- ID: hero-short-validator-copy
- Date: 2025-10-20 01:33 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Shortened hero copy to a concise validator message: headline “Stake With Confidence” and one-line subcopy “KerenStake keeps your stake safe and your rewards steady.”
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Matches the request for brief, punchy copy similar to earlier examples.
- Follow-ups: If you prefer alternatives, we can A/B a few short variants.
Entry
- ID: remove-brand-from-hero-copy
- Date: 2025-10-20 01:38 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Removed brand mention from hero. Badge now reads “Interchain Validator” and the subcopy is brand‑neutral: “Your stake stays safe and rewards stay steady.”
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Complies with request to avoid mentioning the brand name in hero text.
- Follow-ups: If a final brand name is decided later, we can re-introduce it subtly in a secondary line or badge.

- ID: fix-uptime-block-mobile-span
- Date: 2025-10-20 01:45 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Made the Bento “Uptime Block” responsive on mobile by changing its grid span to `col-span-3 lg:col-span-1` so it stacks full-width on small screens like the other tiles. Tweaked Calendar positioning/scaling for small breakpoints.
- Files: components/Bento.tsx
- Rationale: Previously used `col-span-1`, causing a cramped 1/3-width tile on mobile.
- Follow-ups: Review Calendar and chart heights on very small devices; adjust scale further if needed.
Entry
- ID: remove-bento-learn-more-links
- Date: 2025-10-20 01:55 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Removed “Learn more” CTA links from all Bento cards by omitting the link/button sections in `BentoCard`. Cleaned up unused imports and avoided new lint warnings by aliasing unused props.
- Files: components/ui/bento-grid.tsx
- Rationale: Links were not needed and added visual noise on both mobile and desktop.
- Follow-ups: Optionally drop `href`/`cta` from feature definitions later to simplify props.
Entry
- ID: hero-wider-than-bento
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:00 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Increased hero container width slightly beyond Bento (max-w-[74rem] vs Bento’s max-w-6xl ≈ 72rem) to make the hero feel more prominent while staying aligned.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: User requested hero to be a bit wider than the Bento grid.
- Follow-ups: Adjust by a few rem up/down after visual check if needed.
Entry
- ID: trustedby-switch-to-css-scroll
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:08 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Rebuilt TrustedBy to a CSS-only horizontal scroller with duplicated logos, side fade mask, and continuous animation (`.animate-scroll`). Removed rAF/JS ticker for simplicity.
- Files: components/TrustedBy.tsx, app/globals.css
- Rationale: Match the provided markup style and reduce complexity.
- Follow-ups: Swap placeholder logo sources with final assets; adjust speed by tweaking `.animate-scroll` duration.
Entry
- ID: remove-live-badge-in-bento
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:15 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Hid the “Live” status badge in the Bento Notifications tile by adding a `showBadge` prop to `LiveCosmosFeed` (default true) and passing `showBadge={false}` in Bento.
- Files: components/cosmos/LiveCosmosFeed.tsx, components/Bento.tsx
- Rationale: Requested to remove the badge specifically in the grid without affecting other potential usages.
- Follow-ups: If badge is not needed anywhere, we can default it to false or remove the code entirely.
Entry
- ID: navbar-rework-fixed-responsive
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:25 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Rebuilt Navbar to match the provided fixed layout with blurred bottom gradient, max-w-7xl container, inline SVG logo/wordmark, desktop pill buttons (Resources, Developers) and Launch App, plus a mobile dialog sheet with categorized links.
- Files: components/Navbar.tsx
- Rationale: Aligns header visuals and mobile UX with the requested design.
- Follow-ups: Hook up real dropdown menus for desktop triggers if needed; refine mask on the bottom gradient if you want a stronger fade.
Entry
- ID: increase-hero-navbar-gap
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:32 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Added extra top padding to the hero section (`pt-24 md:pt-28`) to create clear spacing below the fixed navbar.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: The fixed header overlapped visually with the hero; this introduces a clean gap.
- Follow-ups: Adjust by a few px if you want tighter/looser spacing.
Entry
- ID: navbar-use-astro-svg-logo
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:38 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Switched navbar logo to use local SVG asset (`/public/astro.svg`) and removed inline SVG wordmark/mark. Added the SVG file.
- Files: components/Navbar.tsx, public/astro.svg
- Rationale: Match request to use astro.svg as the logo source.
- Follow-ups: Replace placeholder astro.svg artwork with the final brand asset if available.
Entry
- ID: navbar-logo-not-showing-fix
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:45 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Replaced Next/Image with a plain <img> for the navbar logo to ensure the local SVG (`/public/astro.svg`) renders without Next/Image SVG restrictions.
- Files: components/Navbar.tsx
- Rationale: User reported the logo not appearing; using <img> avoids optimization constraints.
- Follow-ups: If we want optimization for raster assets later, we can keep Next/Image for PNG/JPG while leaving SVG as <img>.
Entry
- ID: astro-svg-make-visible
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:52 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Updated `/public/astro.svg` to use solid white fills so it’s visible on the dark navbar background (removed currentColor dependency that doesn’t apply via <img>).
- Files: public/astro.svg
- Rationale: The previous SVG used currentColor and gradient, which rendered too dark when embedded as an external image.
- Follow-ups: Replace with the actual brand mark when ready; size remains 22×22 in the navbar.
Entry
- ID: navbar-logo-png-and-name
- Date: 2025-10-20 02:58 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Switched navbar logo to `public/astro@2x.png` and added the brand name text “KERENSTAKE” to the right of the logo.
- Files: components/Navbar.tsx
- Rationale: Match request to use the PNG asset and display the name alongside the mark.
- Follow-ups: Adjust logo size or typography if you want a different visual weight.
Entry
- ID: switch-sans-font-to-inter
- Date: 2025-10-20 03:05 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Replaced Plus Jakarta Sans with Inter via next/font, mapping to the same CSS variable `--font-geist-sans` to avoid refactors.
- Files: app/layout.tsx
- Rationale: User requested changing the default font to a different look.
- Follow-ups: If you prefer a specific font (Aeonik, Satoshi, Space Grotesk), I can wire a local font or another Google font similarly.
Entry
- ID: hero-break-interchain-to-next-line
- Date: 2025-10-20 03:12 UTC
- Author: Agent
- Summary: Updated hero heading to push the phrase “the Interchain.” onto a new line using a block span for better visual emphasis.
- Files: components/hero-section.tsx
- Rationale: Matches request to place “the Interchain” on the line below.
- Follow-ups: Adjust font size/line-height for mobile if needed (e.g., reduce on small screens).
